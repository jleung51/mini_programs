# ROBOTC Dummy Header

C header file which provides dummy definitions for types and functions for the ROBOTC flavor of C.

Including this file allows a file written in ROBOTC to be successfully compiled and run (likely with incomprehensible or illogical results).

The preprocessor variable `NOTROBOTC` must be defined for the header to function properly.
