# Return Change

C++ program which displays an optimal amount of bills and coins to be given as change.

###Todo:
1. Declare denominations[] in ReturnChange() as const.
1. Implement exceptions and try/catch to replace cout error messages and auto-exiting.
1. Use a switch statement in PrintDenomination() rather than if statements.
1. Return an array of the resulting values of each denomination, rather than directly printing the values.
1. Use two values rather than a float for the currency?
